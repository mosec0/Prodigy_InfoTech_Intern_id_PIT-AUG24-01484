<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Import libraries: Import Pillow for image processing and numpy for working with arrays.</p>
<h2>Encryption and decryption functions:</h2>
<p>encrypt_image: Reads the image, applies encryption by adding the key to pixel values, and saves the encrypted image.</p>
<p>decrypt_image: Reads the image, applies decryption by subtracting the key from pixel values, and saves the decrypted image.</p>
<h2>Main function:</h2>
<p>Asks the user to choose the mode (encrypt or decrypt), enter the image path, output path, and encryption key.</p>
<p>Calls the appropriate function based on the user's choice.</p>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>Run the program.</p>
<p>Choose the mode by typing encrypt or decrypt.</p>
<p>Enter the path of the image you want to encrypt or decrypt.</p>
<p>Enter the path where the new image should be saved.</p>
<p>Enter the encryption key (an integer).</p>

<h1>The program will encrypt or decrypt the image based on the inputs and save the new image to the specified path.</h1>
