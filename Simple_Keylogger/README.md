<h2>Explanation:</h2>

    Importing the necessary modules:
        The pynput library is used to capture keyboard events.

    Defining the log file:
        The log_file variable specifies the file where the keystrokes will be logged.

    on_press function:
        This function is called whenever a key is pressed. It logs the key to the specified file.
        It handles both printable characters and special keys (e.g., space, enter).

    on_release function:
        This function is called whenever a key is released.
        It stops the keylogger when the 'Esc' key is pressed.

    main function:
        This is the main function that starts the keylogger and listens for keyboard events.
        The keylogger runs until the 'Esc' key is pressed.

<h2>Usage:</h2>

    Run the program:
        Execute the script in your Python environment.
        The keylogger will start and begin logging keystrokes to the specified file.

    Stop the keylogger:
        Press the 'Esc' key to stop the keylogger.

<h2>Ethical Considerations:</h2>

    Obtain Permission: Always obtain explicit permission from users before logging their keystrokes.
    Inform Users: Ensure that users are fully informed about what data is being collected and why.
    Use Responsibly: Use keyloggers only for legitimate and ethical purposes, such as security monitoring with informed consent.
